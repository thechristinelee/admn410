<h2>History</h2>
<p>
Durham House of Pets was founded in Durham, New Hampshire in 2009 by John and Anne Smith and began selling
pet supplies such as dog leashes and cat food but have grown to sell pets themselves.
John and Anne have realized the selling potential of pets in Durham
to college students and have been selling dogs, cats, and fish since 2011.
Although they started with a simple business plan, they have grown and continue to do so
as they plan to start selling hamsters and rabbits in the fall of 2017. </p>

<h2>Why Use Us</h2>
<p>
DHP offers the best pets on the seacoast at the best prices. We offer
price match guarantee and have been selling pets and their supplies for the past
8 years. We have established relationships with breeders and organizations 
in the surrounding areas and also include all necessary vaccinations for our cats and dogs.
One student even said, "I loved the service at DHP so much when I was a freshman
that I've been buying new pets each year after UNH's Homecoming weekends!" - Jen H. Class of 2017 </p>
